# LuaX and Pandoc based tools

`makex.mk` is a Makefile. It is intended to be included in any Makefile
to easily install some tools based on LuaX and Pandoc to pre-process
files and generate documents, using Lua as a common, simple and powerful
scripting language.

# Introduction

Lots of software projects involve various tools, free as well as
commercial, to build the software, run the tests, produce the
documentation, … These tools use different data formats and scripting
languages, which makes the projects less scalable and harder to
maintain.

Sharing data between configuration files, documentations, tests results
can then be painful and counter productive (the necessary glue is often
more complex than the tools themselves).

Usually people script their build systems and processes with languages
like Bash, Python, Javascript and make them communicate with plain text,
YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, INI, TOML. Every script shall rely on specific
(existing or not) libraries to read and write these data formats.

This document presents a commun and powerful data format and some tools
to script the build process of a project and generate documentation.

To sum up the suggested solution is:

- a **single data format**
- and a **reduced set of highly configurable tools**.

# Installation

Only `makex.mk` is required. Other files from the makex repository are
documentation and examples.

Just download `makex.mk` to a directory where other Makefiles can
include it:

``` sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDSoft/makex/master/makex.mk
```

or

``` sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDSoft/makex/master/makex.mk
```

The full repository is available on Github:
<https://github.com/CDSoft/makex>.

# Usage

`makex.mk` usage is pretty simple:

1.  include `makex.mk` in another Makefile
2.  use `$(LUAX)`, `$(YPP)`, `$(PANDOC_HTML)`, `$(PANDOC_PDF)`, … to
    call `luax`, `ypp`, `pandoc` (to generate HTML or PDF files)

# Lua[^1]

[Lua](https://www.lua.org) is the perfect candidate for both a common
data format and a script language.

## What is Lua?

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting
language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented
programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data
description.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based
virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental
garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
rapid prototyping.

## Why choose Lua?

**Lua is a proven, robust language**

Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe’s
Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the
Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of
Warcraft and Angry Birds). Lua is currently the leading scripting
language in games. Lua has a solid reference manual and there are
several books about it. Several versions of Lua have been released and
used in real applications since its creation in 1993. Lua featured in
HOPL III, the Third ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages
Conference, in 2007. Lua won the Front Line Award 2011 from the Game
Developers Magazine.

**Lua is fast**

Lua has a deserved reputation for performance. To claim to be “as fast
as Lua” is an aspiration of other scripting languages. Several
benchmarks show Lua as the fastest language in the realm of interpreted
scripting languages. Lua is fast not only in fine-tuned benchmark
programs, but in real life too. Substantial fractions of large
applications have been written in Lua.

**Lua is portable**

Lua is distributed in a small package and builds out-of-the-box in all
platforms that have a standard C compiler. Lua runs on all flavors of
Unix and Windows, on mobile devices (running Android, iOS, BREW,
Symbian, Windows Phone), on embedded microprocessors (such as ARM and
Rabbit, for applications like Lego MindStorms), on IBM mainframes, etc.

**Lua is powerful (but simple)**

A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms
for implementing features, instead of providing a host of features
directly in the language. For example, although Lua is not a pure
object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for
implementing classes and inheritance. Lua’s meta-mechanisms bring an
economy of concepts and keep the language small, while allowing the
semantics to be extended in unconventional ways.

**Lua is small**

Adding Lua to an application does not bloat it. The tarball for Lua
5.4.4, which contains source code and documentation, takes 353K
compressed and 1.3M uncompressed. The source contains around 30000 lines
of C. Under 64-bit Linux, the Lua interpreter built with all standard
Lua libraries takes 281K and the Lua library takes 468K.

**Lua is free**

Lua is free open-source software, distributed under a very liberal
license (the well-known MIT license). It may be used for any purpose,
including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost. Just download it
and use it.

# LuaX

[LuaX](https://github.com/CDSoft/luax) is a Lua interpretor and REPL
based on Lua 5.4.4, augmented with some useful packages. LuaX can also
produce standalone executables from Lua scripts.

LuaX runs on several platforms with no dependency:

- Linux (x86_64, i386, aarch64)
- MacOS (x86_64, aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64, i386)

LuaX can cross-compile scripts from and to any of these platforms.

LuaX comes with a standard Lua interpretor and provides some libraries
(embedded in a single executable, no external dependency required):

# Scripting with LuaX

LuaX can be used as a general programming language. There are plenty of
[good documentations for Lua](https://www.lua.org/docs.html) and
[LuaX](http://cdelord.fr/luax).

A big advantage of Lua is the usage of Lua tables as a common data
format usable by various tools. It is Human-readable and structured. It
can be generated by Lua scripts but also by any software producing text
files.

Typical usages are:

- project/software configuration
  - a Lua table can be used to describe a project or a software
    configuration
    - read by an embedded Lua interpretor
    - used to generate documentation or source code
- tests results
  - a test suite can generate test results as a Lua table
  - tests results can be used to render documentation (tests reports)
    and compute a test coverage

The next chapters present some tools written in Lua/LuaX or using Lua as
a scripting engine.

# Ypp

Ypp is a minimalist and generic text preprocessor using Lua macros.

Ypp is compiled by LuaX, i.e. Lua and LuaX functions and modules are
available in macros.

More information here: <http://cdelord.fr/ypp>

Ypp is pretty simple. It searches for Lua expressions and replaces
macros with their results.

| Macro     | Result                                                                           |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@(...)`  | Evaluates the Lua expression `...` and replaces the macro by its result          |
| `@@(...)` | Executes the Lua chunk `...` and replaces the macro by its result (if not `nil`) |

Some expression do not require parentheses (function calls).

## Example

``` markdown
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 = @F.range(100):map(function(x) return x*x end):sum()
$$
```

is rendered as

> $$
> \sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 = 338350
> $$

Macros can also define variables reusable later by other macros.

``` markdown
@@[[
    local foo = 42
    N = foo * 23 + 34
    local function sq(x) return x*x end
    function sumsq(n) return F.range(N):map(sq):sum() end
]]
```

defines `N` ($N = 1000$) which can be read in a Lua expression or with
`@N` and `sumsq` which computes the sum of squares.

Then

``` markdown
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{@N} i^2 = @sumsq(N)
$$
```

becomes

> $$
> \sum_{i=1}^{1000} i^2 = 333833500
> $$

# Pandoc

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a swiss-army knife to convert from and
to a bunch of document formats.

A big advantage of Pandoc is the ability to use Lua scripts to define
custom readers and writers for unsupported formats and also Lua filters
to manipulate the pandoc abstract syntax tree (AST). This is the main
pandoc feature exercised in this document.

Pandoc has an excellent documentation:

- main pandoc documentation: <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>
- Lua filter documentation: <https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html>

This document uses pandoc Lua filters with Panda (see next chapter)
which bundles some useful filters in a single script.

# Panda

Panda is a [Pandoc Lua filter](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) that
works on internal Pandoc’s AST.

It provides several interesting features:

- variable expansion (minimalistic templating)
- conditional blocks
- file inclusion (e.g. for source code examples)
- script execution (e.g. to include the result of a command)
- diagrams (Graphviz, PlantUML, ditaa, Asymptote, blockdiag, mermaid,
  Penrose, lsvg…)

The documentation of Panda is here: <http://cdelord.fr/panda>

## Examples

There are lots of examples in the documentation of panda. We will see
here two of them.

**Documentation extraction from source code**

The source code can be documented by adding special marks in comments.
The documentation shall be written in Markdown. The default mark is
`@@@` and can be customized.

For instance, the following C source contains documentation that can be
extracted and included to a Pandoc document.

```` c
/*@@@
**`answer`** takes any question and returns the most relevant answer.

Example:

``` c
    const char *meaning = answer("What's the meaning of life?");
```
@@@*/

#include <unistd.h>

const char *answer(const char *question)
{
    /* Test all the possibilities */
    for (int y = 0; y < 7500000; y++)
    {
        sleep(365 * 86400);
    }
    /* Returns the most relevant answer */
    return "42";
}
````

To extract the documentation, panda provides a macro to replace a `div`
element by the documentation chunks from a file. E.g.:

``` markdown
:::{doc="deep_thought.c"}
:::
```

will be replaced by:

> **`answer`** takes any question and returns the most relevant answer.
>
> Example:
>
> ``` c
>     const char *meaning = answer("What's the meaning of life?");
> ```

**Diagrams**

Diagrams can be embedded in Pandoc documents. Diagrams are specified as
code blocks and are replaced by an image by panda.

    ```{.dot render="{{dot}}" width=67%}
    digraph {
        rankdir=LR;
        input -> pandoc -> output
        pandoc -> panda -> {pandoc, diagrams}
        { rank=same; pandoc, panda }
        { rank=same; diagrams, output }
    }
    ```

<img src="example/img/fbc1d5fae695b3f059a6a177a655c3e6bd546640.svg"
class="dot" style="width:67.0%" />

    ```{render="{{gnuplot}}" width=67%}
    set xrange [-pi:pi]
    set yrange [-1.5:1.5]
    plot sin(x) lw 4, cos(x) lw 4
    ```
